MCP Setup & AI Agent Configuration Report

What I Did In this task, I configured a modern code orchestrator environment by connecting VS Code to the Tenx MCP Analysis server. The following specific changes were made to the agent rules: File Creation: I created a .github/copilot-instructions.md file to house the instructions for GitHub Copilot. Role Definition: Defined the AI's role as an expert pair programmer specifically optimized for a Windows environment. Instruction Updates: Added rules requiring the agent to "think before acting" and to prioritize the use of Tenx MCP tools for analysis. Environment Mapping: Configured the .vscode/mcp.json file with the correct headers (X-Device: windows and X-Coding-Tool: vscode) to ensure server-side compatibility.
What Worked MCP Connectivity: The server connection was successfully established by using the specific URL (<https://mcppulse.10academy.org/proxy>) and authenticating via GitHub. Rule Recognition: Placing the instructions in the .github/ directory allowed GitHub Copilot to automatically pick up the new context without manual prompting. Header Configuration: Using the "windows" value for the X-Device header ensured that the tools returned were compatible with my operating system.
What Didn't Work (Troubleshooting) Extension Conflicts: Initially, the MCP tools didn't appear in the chat. Troubleshooting: I verified that both GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat were updated to the latest versions as required by the guide. Folder Structure: I originally placed the rules file in the root directory. Troubleshooting: I referred back to the challenge documentation which specified the github/copilot-instructions.md path for VS Code. Authentication Loop: The browser didn't redirect back to VS Code after GitHub authorization. Troubleshooting: I restarted the server using the "start" button in the VS Code MCP panel, which cleared the session cache.
Insights Gained Alignment of Intent: I learned that specific rules, such as "summarize your understanding before acting," prevent the AI from making large, unwanted code changes, aligning it better with my thought patterns. Behavioral Modification: By defining the agent's role clearly, the AI shifted from providing generic code snippets to offering solutions that accounted for Windows-specific terminal commands and file paths. Real-time Feedback: Having an active MCP connection provides a "feedback loop" where the agent's performance is measured, encouraging more deliberate and structured prompts.
