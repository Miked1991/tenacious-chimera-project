# Project Chimera: Meta Specification

## Vision

Build an autonomous AI influencer system that researches trends, generates content, and manages engagement without human intervention.

## Core Principles

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: All implementation must follow ratified specifications
2. **Traceability**: All development must be recorded via MCP Sense
3. **Agentic Architecture**: Clear separation between Developer Tools and Runtime Skills
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Containerized, tested, and automated deployment

## Constraints

- Must integrate with OpenClaw network for agent-to-agent communication
- Human safety layer required for content approval
- Must handle high-velocity video metadata
- All AI-generated code must pass automated tests before deployment

## Success Metrics

- Repository enables AI swarm to build final features with minimal conflict
- All specifications are executable and testable
- Zero-touch deployment pipeline for agent-generated code
